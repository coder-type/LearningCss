      <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A microprocessor is a multipurpose, programmable, clock-driven, register-based electronic device that reads binary instructions from a storage deivce called memory and accepts binary data as input and processes data according to those instructions and then provides results as output.</li>
        <li><strong>History:</strong> First microprocessor was Intel 4004 (4-bit) developed in 1971.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Marcian.E. Hubb was the creator and also known as father of microprocessor. The first commerical microprocessor came in 1971, which was a 4-bit microprocessor having 2300 transistors. It was basically designed for calculators at that time.</li>
        <li>The next intel microprocessor was INTEL 8008 having 3500 transistors after this, INTEL 8080 having 4000 transistors and ZILOG Z80 having 6000 transistors.</li>
        <li>The 4-bit intel microprocessor was continued and the first 8-bit microprocessor was developed which is intel 8085 which is also important for understanding the core of this subject.</li>
        <li>Similarly, the next microprocessor was the intel 8086 microprocessor.</li>
        <li>And then, the evolution of microprocessor continued into PENTIUM III having 9.5 million transistors, here are some of the pentium processors like Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium MMX, Pentium Dual-Core.</li>
        <li>After the Dual-Core Pentium, Intel's primary mainstream processor family became the Core i series, which includes Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.</li>
      </ul>
          <li><strong>Components of Microprocessor</strong> 
            <li>1. Microprocessor (CPU)</li>
            <p>The brain of the system. Executes instructions, performs arithmetic/logical operations, controls data flow. Examples: Intel 8085, 8086, etc.</p>
            
            <li> Memory</li>
            <ul><li> RAM (Random Access Memory)</li></ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Temporary storage (volatile).</li>
                  <li>Stores data and programs during execution.</li>
                </ul>
            
            b. ROM (Read-Only Memory)
            Permanent storage (non-volatile).
            
            Stores boot code or firmware.
            
            3. I/O Devices (Input/Output)
            Used for interaction with the external world.
            
            Input devices: Keyboard, switches, sensors.
            
            Output devices: Display, LEDs, actuators.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
        <li><strong>8085:</strong> It is an 8-bit microprocessor developed by Intel in 1976.</li>
